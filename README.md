Each line of the text file “Students.txt ” contains information about one student: full name, course group. The fields are separated by semicolons. The full name field may contain spaces. The file is large, and the amount of information contained in it is unknown in advance. The information in the file is not organized.
You need to get two new text files. The first file “Fio.txt ” it must contain all the data about the students, arranged alphabetically by last name. The second one “Groups.txt ” - data ordered by courses, for the same course by groups, for the same group alphabetically. Use the vector container.
